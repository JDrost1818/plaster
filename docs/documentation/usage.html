    <h3>Usage</h3>

    <p>
        Plaster is a command line tool which provides a multitude of options in order to change behavior.
        The general syntax of the tool is as follows:
    </p>
    <div id="codeSnippet">
        <pre class="terminal">
            <code id="command-line-usage">
            </code>
        </pre>
    </div>
    <p>
        The basic syntax can be broken down into four parts:
    </p>
    <ul class="indented">
        <li><a class="red-hover blue-text" href="#usage-mode">Mode</a></li>
        <li><a class="red-hover blue-text" href="#usage-scope">Scope</a></li>
        <li><a class="red-hover blue-text" href="#usage-class-info">Class Information</a></li>
        <li><a class="red-hover blue-text" href="?selected=configuration">Configuration</a></li>
    </ul>

</div>

<div id="usage-mode" class="card">
    <h3>Mode</h3>
    <hr class="doc-separator"/>
    <p>
        The mode is the first argument and specifies is to be accomplished. There are three current
        modes for which Plaster supports.
    </p>

    <h4>Generate</h4>
    <p>
        The most common mode. Anytime line(s) of code will be added to the project, generate will be used. Whether
        it is adding a new model, adding a new field to an already existing model, or adding other classes, generate
        will be the mode to choose.
    </p>

    <h4>Delete</h4>
    <p>
        This is the exact opposite of generate. It can remove whole swaths of code from the repository or you
        can pinpoint individual fields.
    </p>

    <h4>Modify</h4>
    <p>
        This is the most specialized mode. The only thing that can be modified are names/types. Use this when you
        have existing fields that are either the wrong type or the wrong name.
    </p>

</div>

<div id="usage-scope" class="card">
    <h3>Scope</h3>
    <hr class="doc-separator"/>
    <p>
        The scope defines the extent to which Plaster is going to perform the mode.
        In order to more easily understand the process, remember which files depend on each other.
        Without being pedantic, notice how each file relies on all files above it in the hierarchy:
    </p>
    <div class="hierarchy row">
        <h6 class="hierarchy-item center-align col s12">Model</h6>
        <h6 class="hierarchy-item center-align col s12">Repository</h6>
        <h6 class="hierarchy-item center-align col s12">Service</h6>
        <h6 class="hierarchy-item center-align col s12">Controller</h6>
    </div>
    <p>
        Therefore, something below cannot exist without everything above. All those in the hierarchy are available
        as a scope. When using as a scope, Plaster will not just do the single file, rather, will do all those required.
        So when generating or deleting, recognize all files the will be affected. Anything above will be generated and
        anything below will be deleted whenever the respective modes are activated.
    </p>

    <h4>Scaffold</h4>
    <p>
        Scaffold is a special scope keyword used to indicate all modes should be activated. This is semantically the
        same as using the controller scope during generation and model during deletion; however, it is included as a
        more intuitive option.
    </p>

    <h4>Note</h4>
    <p>
        The modify mode is the only mode that has restricted access to scopes. It can only be used in tandem with
        the model scope.
